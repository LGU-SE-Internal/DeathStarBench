# Caddy vs OpenResty Configuration Comparison

This directory contains side-by-side configuration examples comparing OpenResty (current) with hypothetical Caddy configurations to illustrate why direct replacement is not feasible.

See the files:
- `openresty-current.conf` - Current working OpenResty configuration
- `caddy-hypothetical.caddyfile` - What Caddy configuration would look like (with limitations noted)
- `caddy-with-gateway.md` - Architecture showing how Caddy could work with a separate API Gateway service
